# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation
Make sure you have installed node in your machine and you have access to npm.

Once you have installed, clone this repository and install all dependencies:
```

$ ce proman-documentation
$ npm install
```
### Local Development
Start local development by running the following command:
```
$  npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build
To deploy all changes build the project using the following command:
```
$ npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
